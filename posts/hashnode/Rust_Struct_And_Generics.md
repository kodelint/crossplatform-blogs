Let’s talk about the some custom **data types** in **Rust** like `struct` and `emuns` . We all know why need **custom data type**, like any other language regular data type may not suffice the need and hence we have custom data types.

### Structs, How to use them in `Rust` ?

**Structure**, `struct` in short, are very similar to `tuple` . **Tuple** are used to store related items with mixed data type in **Order**. Now if the use case is to have large number of elements and the **Order** is not obvious then it could be difficult to identify them out of Tuples

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/kodelint/blog-assets/raw/main/images/01-rust-tuple.png" width="650" height="410" style="float:left; padding-right:20px"/>

```bash
the first element of tuple [a_tuple] is 1
the last element of tuple [a_tuple] is Rust
the first element of tuple [a_tuple] after modification is 6
the last element of tuple [a_tuple] after modification is Rustic
```

So you can see that if number of elements are larger than normal then it becomes very difficult to keep track of the order and that’s when we use **`struct`**.

> _**Struct**_ data are usually stored in usually stored in **stack** given it contain **stack** only data types like _numbers_. To store _Struct_ in **heap** you have specifically mentioned that. Also, if your _**Struct**_ contain **heap** data types like `String` then it will be stored in **heap** and reference, associated data of the **heap** data will be stored in **stack**. So, when your _**Struct**_ instance goes **out of scope** the associated data in **heap** will be **automatically dropped**.

Defining a `struct` in `Rust` is similar to `Golang`. `Golang` require `type` keyword along side with `struct` keyword

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/kodelint/blog-assets/raw/main/images/01-rust-vs-golang-struct.jpeg" width="450" height="310" style="float:left; padding-right:20px"/>

A `struct` is like a `tuple`, which allows you to package together related items with mixed data type, however you don’t need to use the **index** to access the elements, instead you use the field name to access them.

**Struct** also allow us to update an `instance` from another `instance` and the syntax is pretty simple called **update syntax**, which basically tells `complier` if there are missing field in instance should have the same field from previous instance.

```rust
let second_car = Car {
  name : String::*from*("Tesla"),
  model : String::from("Model 3"),
  ..new_car,
};
```

**Any update to the first instance after the second instance initialization will not reflect in second instance.**

> If you see then the missing fields are `int` datatype means they live in **stack**, therefore they gets implicitly copied. However, if there were any `String` datatype involved, it would have error time as it violates the **ownership** **rule** of rust . To make that work we need to use explicit **clone** for copying the data from first instance, something like this **`..new_car.clone()`**. To know more about [ownership and borrowing](https://medium.com/p/5ba45c44f986). Also we have to add `trait` as the `Car` datatype doesn’t have the `trait` to `Clone()` data, so we need to derived that at the **struct definition**, something like this `#[derive(Clone)]`.

### Struct has methods

In Rust we can call subroutines, which are **method** for the **struct**. They are pretty much like a **function** and defined using `fn` key word. The difference is between **methods** and **function** is that **method** are always within the context of the `struct` and the first input parameter is alway the `struct` itself.

To define the **method** we need to `impl` key word _(short for implementation)_ followed by the `struct` name

### Struct has function too

Rust also allow us to create **associated functions**, they are pretty much like `method`, however they don’t take `&self` as argument. They are mostly used to create initialize the new instance of custom datatype, like a **constructors** in other object oriented languages.

<img src="https://github.com/kodelint/blog-assets/raw/main/images/01-rust-associative-function.png" width="870" height="500" />

> There is something call **Struct Tuple**, it is a combination of **Struct** and **Tuple**. In `Rust` **Struct Tuple’s** are defined similarly as **Struct** but they don’t have any named field. It is usually deployed to make a custom type with mixed primary datatypes, however don’t need field to be named. Something like `struct CarFeatures(4, "electric", "falcon doors")`

So this is how the whole code looks like

<img src="https://github.com/kodelint/blog-assets/raw/main/images/01-rust-struct-tuple.png" width="870" height="1500" />

```bash
Car Name: Runner, Model: Tesla Model Y, Year: 2022, Price: $70000/-
Price of Tesla Model Y has increased to $75000/-
Car Name: Beast, Model: Tesla Plaid, Year: 2022, Price: $110000/-
Price of Tesla Plaid has increased to $135000/-
```

### Generic Types … Yay!!

Rust is **statically** type language so a defined `struct`, `function` or `method` can only be used for it own defined variable data types. Which mean you might end up maintaining same code body for `struct`, `function` or `method` with different data types. What if we can define `struct`, `function` or `method` in such a way that we can use any data type with it. Enters…..**Generic Type!!**

<img src="https://github.com/kodelint/blog-assets/raw/main/images/01-rust-generics.jpg" width="970" height="1500" />

Above we have struct `Car` with generic type _(denoted using `<..>`)_ `<S,I,T>` which feeds the `type` for struct fields. Similarly, a `impl` block to define `new_car` and `update_price` **methods**. They are also using generic types. Lastly, a function choose with `generics`, used to get confirm for the right choice based on `electric_per_unit` and `gas_per_gallon` price constraints.

> Don’t worry about the `traits` like `std::cmp::PartialOrd` and `std::ops::AddAssign` for now. I will have separate blog explaining them. For now, we need them because `rust` complier doesn’t know what kind of data types `generics` will have to perform **`comparison`** and **`addition`**.

### Box Datatype

One more thing I want touch is the **Box datatype** in rust . **Box** datatype are usually used to put the data in **heap** instead of **stack**. In simple words **stack** are usually small in size and when you are storing data which can be large in size like a `trait` or `struct` _(combination of different datatypes and sizes)_, you might want to store them in **heap** and have reference of that stored in **stack**

> **Note**: If you are making the data to be **boxed**, means moving it from **stack** to **heap** using `box datatype`. It performs the **move** operation, not **copy**, so previous location in **stack** gets **de-allocated**.

![](https://github.com/kodelint/blog-assets/raw/main/images/02-rust-struct-box-type.jpg)

```bash
I bought Model X in 2021 for $120000, it is an electric Vehicle
Market prediction is that Model X in 2022 will be for $140000
BEFORE BOXING, Car struct data size is 56 bytes in Stack
Price Changed: in Inventory aka Stack, Now Price is $140000
BOXING the data.....
AFTER BOXING, Car struct data size is 8 bytes in Stack
Car struct data size is 56 bytes in Heap, because we are using de-referencing operator `*` to access the data
DATA AFTER BOXING: Model X Price: $140000 Fuel Type: electric
```

As you can see that when I used the `boxed_car` variable as `box` type data got moved from **stack** to **heap**. Now, **stack** only contains the reference of the data _(hence `8` bytes)_ and actual data is in **heap** _(hence `56` bytes)_
and we are using `&` for the reference for the data in **stack** and de-referencing operator `*` to fetch the size of the data in **heap**

Hope this explains some of the internal and usage of `structs` and `generics` in `Rust`. I will have more write-ups coming for other important concepts of `Rust`

### Happy Programming!!
